# Make a UI that is easy to navigate

# 1: First option would be to connect to the server or close the program
# in the beginning make a version that does not connect to the internet
# But in the end it needs to connect to the internet

#1.5: Try to create the db with first function

# 2: Create a function that can write to a database keep it local first and then later try to make it work over the internet

# 3 Implement a function that makes changeing users possible

# 4 Implement threaing in all classes
